How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
When coding I try to deploy the development tips that I have learned in previous classes.  Create small sections at a time then attempt to compile.  Once I feel that piece is complete I will continue on to other sections.  I also try to save often in case I lose connection or make a mistake I can not undo.
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
First I review the goal and requirements of the program and make sure both match.  If something seems off this will allow me to ask follow-up questiong before I being working.  Once I being working on the code I like to keep a printed list of requirements on my desk for easy access.  This helps me to ensure all the requirements are included into the program.  
How do I approach designing software?
My approach to designing software is meeting all requirements in the most efficient way possible.  I generally try to design my code in a very simple and effective manner.  This reduces room for mistakes and errors.  My goal is to get the job done with as few lines as possible.
